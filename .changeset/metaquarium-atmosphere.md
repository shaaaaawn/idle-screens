Atmosphere pack, no composer: `fogNear`/`fogFar` (the previously hardcoded Fog(60, 500) becomes steerable), `moteDensity`/`moteColor` (seeded plankton drifting closed-form in the vertex shader — one time uniform, zero CPU per frame, tier-capped 400/250/120), and `floorColor`. Every default reproduces the pre-atmosphere constants exactly, so existing scenes are pixel-identical until steered. The package `demoTrack` is now a 40s looping tour of every steerable feature.
