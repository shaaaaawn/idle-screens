Draco support: many Metaquarium models are `KHR_draco_mesh_compression`-required and were silently rendering as fallback blobs, because `GLTFLoader` without a decoder fails deep inside parse with no usable signal. The package now ships three's own gltf decoder in `dist/draco/` (no CDN, works offline on the native hosts), sniffs the GLB container so the decoder is only instantiated when a model actually needs it, shares one decoder per page, and exposes a `dracoPath` param for hosts that serve it from their own static path. Hosts that rebundle this package into a single chunk must copy `dist/draco/` next to that chunk or set `dracoPath` — `import.meta.url` will not find the decoder inside `node_modules`. Unlocks the ~30x-smaller model variants (shark 62KB vs 2MB).
