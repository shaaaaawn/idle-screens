'@idle-screens/saver-metaquarium': patch

Hardening pass (Phase 0 of the overhaul): fish identity keys off the spawn slot instead of GLB-arrival order (prerequisite for mixed breeds); steered `swimSpeed` glides via the closed-form speed-curve integral instead of teleporting; teardown disposes only tank-owned GPU resources (template-shared geometry and eyes materials are never touched; per-clone skeleton boneTextures now freed); the fish pool allocates what `fishCount` asks and grows on demand as documented; tracked numbers clamp to their declared range and coerce stringified values.
