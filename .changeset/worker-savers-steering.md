Worker/OffscreenCanvas rendering for canvas savers (`workerReady`, generation-token mount races fixed); new savers (pipes, bsod, flurry, fluid, reaction-diffusion, mystify) with WebGPU dual-path where applicable and WKWebView GPU skip; schema v2 primitives (alpha, blend, region, pulse, soft) plus published SaverSpec JSON Schema + FORMAT.md; live steering via `applyTrack` on compiled specs (`steer` helpers exported); host-owned fallback slot on `<idle-screen>` (`slot="fallback"` when mount fails); `previewAt` hook for timeline-driven previews; security: prototype-pollution guard in `resolveSpecPath`, `validateSpec` gate on track deltas, worker mount clears fallback class
